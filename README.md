# Cybercriminal_detection
This is a Python implementation of a paper that has been published on ripublication.com. In the paper the traits, behaviuors, influencing factors and characters of a potential cyber criminal is given from a study of over 20 people. 
In our python program we train a classifier model (logistic regression) to classify our subject either he/she is a criminal or not based on the factors stated by the paper. The user sees a bunch pf characters of a potential cybercriminal and compares it with the person he wants to see whether has such characters and the model after receieving the input from the user classifies the subject into set of three possibilities. 
1. Either he/she is a cybercriminal.
2. He/She isn't a vybercriminal but should be taken close look for as he exceeds certain threshold that is favourable for a normal person.
3. He/She isn't a cybercriminal.
